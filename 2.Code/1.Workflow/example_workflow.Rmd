```{r settings, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup

Begin by installing and loading the packages that are needed for the workflow.

```{r package load, message = FALSE}
invisible(source("../2.Functions/00_package_loading.R"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
