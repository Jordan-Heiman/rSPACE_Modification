## Introduction

This repo holds a modified version of the scripts developed by @ellis_2015 as part of the rSPACE package. These scripts allow for spatial and effort variability in sampling as described in Heiman et al. (2024).

This compilation of scripts and functions are sourced from the original rSPACE package and modified to include variable sampling simulations. All source code was also annotated to include a description of each line of code. All function source code can be found in 2.Code/2.Functions.

## Example Workflow
An example workflow can be found in 2.Code/1.Workflow
