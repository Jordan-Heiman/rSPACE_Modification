## Introduction

This repo holds a modified version of the scripts developed by Ellis et
al. (2015) as part of the rSPACE package. These scripts allow for
spatial and effort variability in sampling as described in Heiman et
al. (2024).

This compilation of scripts and functions are sourced from the original
rSPACE package and modified to include variable sampling simulations.
All source code was also annotated to include a description of each line
of code. All function source code can be found in 2.Code/2.Functions.

## Example Workflow

An example workflow can be found in 2.Code/1.Workflow
